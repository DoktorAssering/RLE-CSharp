## Spring Compressor (C#)

A simple C# project for string compression and recovery using the Run-Length Encoding (RLE) algorithm. It is suitable for learning how to work with strings, counters, loops, as well as for demonstrating high-quality architecture and low-level code.

## Task description

**We compress the lines of the form**:  
`aaabbcccdde` = `a3b2c3d2e`  
- Duplicate characters are encoded as `letter + digit'.
- Single characters remain unnumbered.

**Restoring the string back**:
`a3b2c3d2e` = `aaabbcccdde`
